## Introduction

This is a little game we made for two reasons : the challenge it represents itself and we did not know any game like this. Hope you will enjoy it.

## How to run

*   You can first [download the last stable release](https://github.com/vincentmorin1/minigame/releases), unzip it and launch it.
*   You can also pull the repository's content (make sure you have already install OpenGL and SDL libraries first):
    1. `git clone git@github.com:vincentmorin1/minigame.git`
    2. `make && make run` (executable file will be in **bin/** directory)

## License
